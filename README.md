This project is a simple web-based palindrome checker that allows users to input text and checks if it reads the same forwards and backwards. 
Topics learned and applied:
- JavaScript Functions and Logic: Practiced creating functions to manipulate and analyze strings, using logic to verify if an input is a palindrome.
- HTML Form Handling: Learned to create and manage HTML forms, including taking user input for processing.
- String Manipulation: Gained experience with JavaScript string methods (e.g., toLowerCase(), replace(), split(), reverse(), join()) to handle palindrome checking.
- CSS Styling for Results: Styled output to indicate clearly if the input text is a palindrome or not, using conditional CSS for visual feedback.
